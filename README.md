xinhui zidian (新回字典)
=======================

The repo name - xinhui zidian (新回字典) is a pun on the name of the most famous dictionary in China - xinhua zidian (新华字典). The word hua (华) refers to the Chinese ethnicity, while hui (回) refers to Chinese Muslims. This way of writing Chinese using Perso-Arabic script originated from the Hui Chinese, and so this repository is named for them.
